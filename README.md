# Optimizing matrix multiplication on an RTX 3050

I'm doing some experiments to see how fast I can perform a batched matrix
multiplication on two 32-bit float tensors of shape (100, 1000, 1000) on an RTX 3050 GPU.

## Baseline analysis

The RTX 3050 has 18 streaming multiprocessors with 128 cores each, for a total of 2304 cores.
It runs at a boost clock speed of 1.47 GHz, for a total of ~3.39T cycle-cores per second.
At two floating-point operations per clock cycle,
the chip can achieve 6.77 TFLOPS.

1.042 GHz
6.774 TFLOPS
168 GB/s

The matrix multiplication requires 2*100*1000*1000*1000 = 200 billion floating-point operations.  
Assuming 6.774 TFLOPS (and zero overhead) gives a time of 30 ms to perform the 
batched matrix multiplication.
I'll take 30 ms as a theoretical maximum speed.
Of course, this doesn't take into account the time required for memory access
and any other computational overhead.

Experiments with pytorch consistently show that the calculation takes 47-48 ms.
(Note: Be sure to warm up the processor first by repeating the calculation a few times.
The first run you do will take significantly longer.)
Pytorch takes about 1.6 times the theoretical best time.  Pretty good!


(L1 cache: 128 KB per SM.  L2 cache: 2 MB total.)

## A simple first attempt

I put together a simple CUDA C++ implementation of batched matrix multiplication on pytorch-style tensors,
with arbitrary dimension, shape and stride.

I assigned each thread to compute a single entry of the output tensor
(so our example will spin up 100 million threads),
and I packed 1024 threads per block, the maximum value (for a total of about 98,000 blocks).

The calculation took ~840 ms, 28 times the theoretical best time, and 18 times slower than pytorch.

Looks like we have some optimizing to do.

## First thoughts

The kernel is probably memory-bound, not compute-bound.
It requires a total of 200 billion floating-point operations,
but 800 GB of memory reads.
(At each step in the matrix-multiplication loop,
the kernel reads one float from each matrix, and does one multiplication and one addition:
two FLOPs and 8 bytes.)
But memory reads are much more expensive than compute:
the chip can compute about 6 TFLOPS, but memory bandwidth is only about 168 GB/s.
The memory performance will be slightly faster due to caching,
but I still expect memory to be the bottleneck.

The natural idea is to try thread coarsening or tiling.
I want to load some input data once and compute on it many times.
If one thread is responsible for computing a small box of matrix entries, rather than just one,
that thread can use its memory access more efficiently.
And by using shared memory
(low-latency memory which is shared among all threads in a block)
I can arrange for several threads to collaborate using data that is only loaded (from slow global memory) once.

But first I want to pick some low-hanging fruit, and check out Nvidia's profiler.


## Cutting down on shape-and-stride calculations

The kernel includes logic to handle arbitrary shapes and strides.
I think this logic is imposing a lot of unnecessary cost.

To start with, the shape-and-stride calculation is being done in the kernel:
each of my 100 million threads is reading the shapes and strides of the input tensors
and computing the index of the one entry it needs to access.
That's a lot of repeated calculation.
Worse yet, the shapes and strides are stored in vectors
whose length (the dimension of the tensor) is unknown at compile time.
This means that the vectors are stored in global memory, resulting in
a lot of unnecessary memory access.
(Actually, since these values are accessed so often, 
they are probably stored in a low-level cache...)

Most matrix multiplication in practice works on batched matrices with a simple structure:
the matrices are contiguous in memory, in row-major order;
and the "matrix dimensions" are the two dimensions with the smallest strides.
So, I'll try to optimize a simple case first:
a batched matrix product of two three-dimensional (batch, row, col) tensors.

In any case, I wrote a new kernel matmul_3d()
that assumes its inputs are contiguous three-dimensional tensors,
and accepts the shape directly as argument to the function.
The result: from 840ms down to 800ms.

## Profiling and increasing occupancy
Nvidia provides a powerful profiler, ncu.
The profiler shows lots of interesting metrics, including memory throughput, cache (L1 and L2) throughput, compute throughput, occupancy and workload statistics...
It even offers helpful suggestions for optimization.

In this case, ncu is telling me that my occupancy (threads per SM) is only about 64%.
Why is this?
On the RTX 3050, each SM can handle a maximum of 1536 threads.
But I'm allocating 1024 threads per block, and the scheduler must assign full blocks to a single SM.
Since 1536 is not a multiple of 1024, this is wasting capacity.

OK, let's try changing threads-per-block to 768.

The results are terrible.  Yes, ncu tells me occupancy is up to 96%.  But runtime is also up, from 800ms to 1.61 sec.
(I also tried 512 threads per block, with similar results.)

What's going on?  I think occupancy is not the most important statistic here.
The SM doesn't have 1536 cores -- it has 128.
The SM can hold additional threads as a way to hide latency:
at any given time most of the threads will be inactive,
while only a small fraction (1/12 at full occupancy, 1/8 if I allocate 1024 threads per block)
will be performing compute.
This lets the SM put a thread on pause while it waits for memory to load.

OK, but why did making smaller blocks slow the program down?
I'm guessing it's a question of caching.
Threads in the same block access a lot of the same memory.
Because of row-major indexing, threads in a block will be responsible for computing
one or two rows of the output matrix -- which means they will all access
the same one or two rows of the first input matrix.
This gives a sort of "economy of scale" from large block size,
which is a more important factor than occupancy.

OK, let's try to get more economies of scale.  Back to memory access.

## Improving memory efficiency

To start with, I'm going to make two improvements to the kernel.
- Load inputs into shared memory, in batches, and
- make each thread responsible for more than one output entry.

I'm going to make configurable parameters for:
- TILE_ROWS and TILE_COLS -- these determine how many output values each thread will calculate;
- TPB_ROW and TPB_COL -- these determine how many threads in a block; and
- MUL_LOOP_TO_LOAD -- the multiplication loop size.

This last parameter needs some explanation.
Each block of threads is responsible for computing a (TILE_ROWS*TPB_ROW) by (TILE_COLS*TPB_COL) submatrix
of the output matrix.
To do this it will need to access some number of full rows of the first input,
and some number of full columns of the second;
then it will loop over the columns of the first input (and the rows of the second).

There might not be enough room in shared memory for all the rows and columns that need to be loaded.
So, instead of being loaded in full, they will be loaded in blocks of MUL_LOOP_TO_LOAD.
In other words: matrix multiplication involves a summation over the intermediate dimension;
we will break that summation into chunks of size MUL_LOOP_TO_LOAD,
and compute partial sums one chunk at a time.

I'll start with some values that seem reasonable:
- TPB_ROW = TPB_COL = 32.  This achieves the max threads per block (1024); dividing it evenly between rows and columns minimizes the total amount of data that needs to be loaded into shared memory.
- TILE_ROWS = TILE_COLS = 8.  I'm not sure what the best value is here (we'll come back to this below) but let's start with 8.
- MUL_LOOP_TO_LOAD = 16.  This is dictated by the 48KB limit on shared memory.  (Actually, I could make this value as large as 24, but maybe it's better to stick with powers of 2 to start.)

The results: 800ms slows down to 1.85 sec.  Terrible.

The profiler tells me that L1 cache is the bottleneck: L1 cache throughput is at 98%.  
I suppose, by putting everything in shared memory, I'm creating too much strain on that one resource...

## Improving memory access patterns

Global memory is stored in DRAM; shared memory (and the L1 cache) are stored in SRAM.
DRAM reads memory in consecutive 32-byte chunks; if I don't use all 32 bytes, I'm wasting bandwidth.
SRAM memory is stored in 32 banks (each 4 bytes wide -- so for example bank 0 is responible for addresses 0, 1, 2, 3 modulo 128).
In a single read, SRAM can read any 4-bite word from each of its 32 banks, independently.
So we want each thread in a warp to try to read from a different bank.
If multiple threads request data from the same bank, the result is a "bank conflict":
the SRAM will have to perform multiple physical reads before the result can be returned.

In both situations, a good pattern is for the 32 threads in a warp to access consecutive floats in memory:
idx = threadIdx.x;
data[idx] ... .

First, I'll make sure the number of rows in each block of threads is 32 (at least when the matrices have >= 32 rows);
this means each warp is exactly one row.

Now let's plan how to arrange memory and threads.  As far as memory:
- The input tensors are already laid out contiguous in row-major order, we can't change that;
- The result tensor is also in row-major order; we can't touch it either;
- But the "shared" tensors (copies of tiles of input tensors that reside in shared memory) can be arranged how we like.

And as far as thread arrangement, we have to decide how to divide up each of these three operations among threads in the block:
- Copy input tensor a into shared memory;
- Copy input tensor b into shared memory;
- Perform the "multiplication loop" to compute entries of output tensor.

Let's start with the entries of the output tensor.  Conceptually it looks something like the following.
1: for (loop_idx = 0; ... ) {
2:     cml_sum += a_shared[row][loop_idx] * b_shared[loop_idx][col];
3: }
4: result[row][col] += cml_sum;

A natural choice is to have consecutive threads operate on the same "row" and consecutive "col":
this way the global memory writes at line 4 are efficient, with all 32 threads in the warp
writing to one 128-bit line of global memory (or two lines, if the alignment isn't right).
Assuming b_shared is stored in row-major order, the shared memory reads in line 2 are good as well:
all threads read the same entry from a_shared, which is efficient (it's called "broadcasting"),
and the 32 threads write to 32 consecutive entries of b_shared.

As for copying global 'a' and 'b' into shared 'a_shared' and 'b_shared': it's the same idea.
I store 'a_shared' and 'b_shared' in row-major order, so data that is contiguous in 'a' 
is also contiguous in 'a_shared'.
Then I arrange for all the threads in the block to handle consecutive floats, one float each.

Anyway, this gives me a substantial speedup: the benchmark is down to 340ms.


# More optimizations

At this point I came across this terrific [blog post](https://www.aleksagordic.com/blog/matmul)
by Aleksa Gordic, which inspired me to try some further optimizations:

- Vectorize reads from global into shared memory, using reinterpret_cast<float4 *> --> 310 ms.
